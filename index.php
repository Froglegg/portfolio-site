<p1>Hello! My name's Hayes Crowley. I built this site from scratch.</p1><br><br>
<p1>I'm a bit of a generalist and have a broad skill set, including full-stack web development, technical writing, web analytics and content strategy. I've often found myself working closely with both digital and marketing teams, and often as conduit between the two. I also have <a href="files/images/turco.jpg" style="color:#2b1818!important; font-weight: 900!important;">some wicked PhotoShop skills.</a></p1> <br><br>
<p1>View samples of <a href="projects.php"  style="color:#2b1818!important; font-weight: 900!important;">projects I've worked on</a> and <a href="cv.php" style="color:#2b1818!important; font-weight: 900!important;">review my resume.</a> <a href="contact.php" style="color:#2b1818!important; font-weight: 900!important;">Send me a message here</a> if you'd like to chat. </p1><br><br>
